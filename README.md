<ul>
<li>Able to Drag-and-Drop text files with Latitude/Longitude pairs to compare with current location.</li>
<li>Current Location can be changed by dragging the map with the cursor.</li>
<li>The map uses the OpenLayers API with OpenStreetMap.</li>
<li>Able to search for a location by Latitude/Longitude.</li>
<li>No Front-end Framework was used, all CSS was made personally.</li>
</ul>

The marker loads correctly as long as the OpenLayers is outside an img directory with the marker inside.
